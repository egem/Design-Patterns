# Design Patterns Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns in C++. The goal is to provide a structured and practical reference for commonly used design patterns.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before building the project:

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (version 3.x or higher)

## Building the Project
To build the project, run the following commands:

```sh
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## Running the Executable
Once the build is complete, assuming that the current directory is the `build` directory, you can run the executable separately as follows:

```sh
$ ./Behavioral/CommandPattern/RemoteControl/RemoteControl
```

or

```sh
$ ./Creational/Builder/Html/Html
```
