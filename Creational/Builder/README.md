**Summary**: Separates object construction from its representation

The **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of an object from its representation. It allows the same construction process to create different types or representations of an object.

The **Builder Pattern** is particularly useful when an object needs to be created step by step, and its parts may be assembled in different ways.
