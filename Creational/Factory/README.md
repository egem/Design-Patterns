**Summary**: Creates an instance of several derived classes

The **Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

It helps in achieving loose coupling by delegating the instantiation of objects to a specialized function or class.
