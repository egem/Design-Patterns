**Summary**: Creates an instance of several families of classes

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows clients to instantiate products from a family of products without knowing the specific class being used, promoting loose coupling.
