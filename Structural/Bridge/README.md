**Summary**: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

The **Bridge Pattern** is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently. This is useful when a system has multiple orthogonal dimensions that should be varied independently.

#### Key Concepts
**Abstraction**: Defines an interface that contains a reference to an implementation object.
**Implementation**: Defines the concrete implementation details.
**Decoupling**: The abstraction and implementation can be developed independently.
